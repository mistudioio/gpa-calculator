# 🎓 Life GPA Scholarship Calculator

This interactive GPA calculator helps students estimate their projected GPA to determine eligibility for the LIFE Scholarship. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, it features a clean, mobile-responsive UI and handles both current and future semester data.

## 📌 Features

- Current earned hours and GPA (currently hard-coded but would be database-driven in production)
- Add projected semester hours and GPAs
- Automatically calculates:
  - Total projected hours
  - Total projected quality points
  - Projected life GPA
- Real-time input validation and GPA capping at 4.0

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla + jQuery)
- Bootstrap 3

## 💡 Notes

In a real-world implementation:
- `'Student Name'`, `'Hours Earned to Date'`, and `'Current GPA'` would be dynamically pulled from a student database.
- Data persistence could be added with a backend or local storage.
